Getting Started
------------------------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or OS X** — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **Ruby, version 1.9.3 or newer**
 - **Bundler** — If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Getting Set Up

 1. Clone the repository to your hard drive with `git clone git@github.com:WebLogicNow/tether-api-docs.git`
 2. `cd tether-api-docs`
 3. Install all dependencies: `bundle install`
 4. Start the test server: `bundle exec middleman server`

You can now see the docs at <http://localhost:4567>. Whoa! That was fast!

Now that Slate is all set up your machine, you'll probably want to learn more about [editing Slate markdown](https://github.com/tripit/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax), or [how to publish your docs](https://github.com/tripit/slate/wiki/Deploying-Slate).
